      "problem": "Many residents lack a single, easy channel to manage bulky waste, e-waste, and recycling. Information is scattered across multiple platforms which makes people miss collection days and struggle during urgent or out-of-schedule disposal. Booking RoRo bins and paying permits often requires separate systems which slows everything down. Unclear e-waste guidance leads to unsafe disposal.",
      "solution": "EcoLink unifies disposal info, booking, payments, reporting, and community micro-jobs. Users can locate recycling and e-waste points, schedule bulky pickups, book RoRo bins with permits, submit reports on missed collections or illegal dumping, and discover/offer cleanup gigs. Councils can post announcements and manage responses in one place.",
